<!-- STORY 1 -->
<div class="card fade-in"
data-title="The Last Letter of Basantapur"
data-content="When the old postbox beside Basantapur stopped receiving letters, people assumed the age of ink had ended. But one winter evening, a final envelope appeared. It was addressed to no one and everyone. Inside was a story of a boy who promised to return after chasing distant dreams. Years passed, cities changed, but Basantapur waited. The letter confessed that home is not a location but a memory that refuses to fade. The writer never returned, yet every sunset in the square whispers his apology into the temple bells.">

<div class="card fade-in"
data-title="The Girl Who Collected Sunsets"
data-content="Anaya believed sunsets were unfinished paintings. Each evening she climbed the hill beyond her village carrying jars of clear glass. She would hold them up, letting orange skies pour inside. People laughed, but her room slowly filled with glowing memories. Years later, when storms took away the colors of her world, she opened the jars. Light spilled across the walls and reminded her that beauty, once witnessed, never truly disappears.">

<div class="card fade-in"
data-title="The Clockmaker of Patan"
data-content="In a narrow alley of Patan lived a clockmaker who never wore a watch. He repaired time for others but refused to measure his own. One day a child asked why. The old man replied that time should be felt in heartbeats, not ticks. When he passed away, every clock in the alley paused for a single breath, honoring the man who stitched broken hours back together.">

The courtyard had not been forgotten. It had only been waiting for footsteps brave enough to remember it.">
